# CZ4042-Age-Gender-Prediction

**Note:** While Running the second run, download the dataset again by running the code in the ipynb notebook as the dataset has been removed temporarily from sagemaker studio lab due to storage and memory constraints.

Things to Improve:

1. Try Improving the Regression Part of the CNN - either add more layers, hyperparameter tune, or add a Resnet to it to see if it would improve
2. Remove the Outliers [cap at 0-100 years] for the age and see if this makes a difference
